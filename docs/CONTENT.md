# Content

## File Structure

All markdown files live inside of the `src/content` folder and follow the site navigation. They live inside a folder that is named the same as the file unless it is a page with tabbed navigation. "Tabbed" pages _(for example Getting Starter > Developers)_ should have all the pages inside the same folder, with the file name matching the page title.

```
src
├── content
   ├── approach
      ├── approach.md
      ├── design-philosophy
          ├── design-philosophy.md
```

## Frontmatter

The top of each markdown file has required frontmatter fields to display the title for the page.

```
---
title: Page Title
---
```

Required fields are:

- `title`: The title of the page

## Markdown

    ### This generates an H2 heading `expressive-paragraph-01`

    ### This generates an H3 heading. `heading-03`

    #### This generates an H4 heading. `heading-02`

    **This is bold text.**

    _This is italic text._

### Link

You can create an inline link by wrapping link text in brackets [ ], and then wrapping the URL in parentheses ( ).

`[Carbon](http://www.carbondesignsystem.com/)`

If you need a link to open in a new window you will have to use standard html to target the new window.

`<a href="http://www.carbondesignsystem.com" target="_blank">Carbon</a></p>`

### Images

### Video

`vimeo: https://vimeo.com/293453905`

### Lists

```
- This is a bulleted list
- List item 2

1. This is an ordered list
2. List item 2
```

### Tables

    | COL 1      | COL 2   |  COL 3     |
    |------------|---------|------------|
    | Row 1A     | Row 1B  | Row 1C     |
    | Row 2A     | Row 2B  | Row 2C     |
    | Row 3A     | Row 3B  | Row 3C     |

### Quotes

Quotes will be displayed differently depending on what column they are placed in. Below is an example of an italic quote that would be placed in the sidebar(col-3 & col-4), these sidebar quotes will display with the top decorative border, they are not italic by default. Quotes placed in the main content blocks (col-7) will display in blue text.

```

### Paragraph

Paragraphs have four available sizes. The default is 16px/1rem, or `size="md"`. This is the default for any text on the page and does not need to be wrapped in a `<p>` tag.

- **sm:** `body-short-01` 14px
- **md:** `body-short-02` 16px
- **lg:** `heading-03` 20px
- **xl:** `expressive-paragraph-01` responsive type

```
<p size="sm">This is a paragraph with small text</p>
<p size="md">This is the default paragraph size</p>
<p size="lg">This is a large paragraph</p>
<p size="xl">This is the largest responsive paragraph size</p>
```

## Custom Markdown Components

**IMPORTANT** If using markdown inside of custom components you **must** have an empty space between the component tag and the markdown or the html won't render.

```
<component>

## Markdown

</component>
```

### Title Block

A wrapper component for the full height black title blocks at the top of the main pages.

`<title-block>`

### Anchor Links

Adds ↳ as bullet for an anchor list of links. Used within the `<title-block>` component and also on the page.

```
<anchor-links>

- [How we work](#how-we-work)
- [Dimensions of diversity](#dimensions-of-diversity)
- [Work with us](#work-with-us)

</anchor-links>
```

## Custom Grid Components

This website uses the default Carbon grid, in order to to this you will need to wrap your content inside custom grid components.

### Grid

All content and componnents will need to be wrapped innside a `<grid>` component **except** the `<title-block>`, which utilizes its own grid code.

The grid component has a prop, background, which is used to tell the section what background color to use. The following colors are available.

- `black`
- `white`
- `gray-10`
- `gray-20`
- `gray-100`
- `black-white` _50/50 gray-100 and white, gray-100 on top_

The other prop available is `classname` which alows you to add a class you can target via css to the wrapping div. We are using the following classnames.

`background--header`
`background--tile`

```
<grid background="gray-10" classname="background--header">

Markdown, html, custom components

</grid>
```

### Column

Columns are used inside of the `<grid>` component to create your page layouts. Layout is based on the Carbon 16 column grid.

_There 16 columns at large breakpoint, 8 columns at medium an 4 columns at small_

The following options are available

- `border` _default to false, true sets a left border and aligns svg to bottom, see Design Thinking page for example_
- `lg` _how many columns the content should span at the large breakpoint_
- `md` _how many columns the content should span at the large breakpoint_
- `sm` _how many columns the content should span at the large breakpoint_
- `offset_lg` _how many columns you want to content offset by at the large breakpoint_

If you only add a value for the large breakpoint then the columnn will default to full width at smaller breakpoints.

**IMPORTANT** If using markdown inside of custom components you **must** have an empty space between the component tag and the markdown or the html won't render.

```
<grid background="gray-10">
<column lg="6" offset_lg="2">

## Markdown and content here

</column>
<column lg="4">

Content here

</column>
</grid>
```

## Tiles

There are several tile styles used across the site.

The following options are available

- `caption` optional secondary text for clickable tile
- `title` clickable tile title
- `href` tile link
- `dark` default to false, show dark clickable tile
- `feature` efault to false, display as feature tile, with text options
- `feature_heading` feature heading, only displas if feature is true
- `feature_heading_secondary` feature heading, only displays if feature is true for alt style
- `feature_description` feature description, only displas if feature is true
- `feature_background` feature block background color, accepts same values as grid
- `feature_style` feature style, default or alt

#### Standard tile, will display differently depending on col wrapper component (see Impact page)

```
  <tile title="IBM Q, System One" caption="impact/quantum" href="http://www.google.com">
    <img src="images/Image_2.png" alt="quantum computer"/>
  </tile>
```

#### Feature

```
<tile
    href="#"
    title="Design Thinking"
    feature="true"
    feature_heading="See how we bring our philosophy to bear in our design systems."
    feature_background="black">
<img src="images/Image_2.png" alt="Geometric shapes"/>
</tile>
```

#### Feature alt (used on Approach page)

This is the only style that does not live inside a grid wrapper, the grid code is contained in the tile component.

```
<tile
    feature="true"
    feature_style="alt"
    feature_heading="Design Philosophy"
    feature_heading_secondary="The beliefs behind everything we do."
    feature_background="black"
    feature_description="Design is about giving people a path, both emotionally and functionally, towards their goals."
    href="/approach/design-philosophy"
    title="Learn more">
<img src="images/Image_1.svg" alt="Geometric shapes"/>
</tile>
```
