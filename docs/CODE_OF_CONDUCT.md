## Code of Conduct

This is a place to ask questions, work through any challenges, and share ideas and best practices. The following suggestions and guidelines are intended to make the community easier and more enjoyable to use.

### TLDR;

- **Be respectful & understanding.** Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior or poor manners. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively.

* **Be welcoming.** We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities.

### General

Communication through any of IBM's channels (GitHub, emails, Twitter, Slack) must be constructive and never resort to personal attacks, trolling, public or private harassment, insults, or other unprofessional conduct.

We promise to extend courtesy and respect to everyone involved in this project, regardless of gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, age, race, ethnicity, religion, or level of experience. We expect anyone contributing to do the same.

If any member of the community violates this Code of Conduct, the maintainers of the project may take action, including removing issues, comments, and PRs or blocking accounts, as deemed appropriate.

### Slack

1. Please, no `@here` or `@channel` unless it is a bug that is **breaking production code.** We have communities in many different time zones, and we would hate to disrupt someone not at the office.
2. There's no need to notify the team that you have made an issue in our's GitHub repositories. We check these several times a day, so we promise we'll address your issue as soon as we can.
3. Reserve direct messages for sensitive discussions, such as privacy, legal, or HR reasons. Otherwise, we encourage posting in public channels so people with the same questions can benefit.
