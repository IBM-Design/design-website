I learned to code, I learned how to restart the servers, I learned to quell the angry creep who would call when we did so.

We were given a target of release cycle of one city a month instead of the usual six to eight-month release cycle. We had to rethink the entire experience from a rich and curated experience to bare bones and data-driven while still being engaging.
