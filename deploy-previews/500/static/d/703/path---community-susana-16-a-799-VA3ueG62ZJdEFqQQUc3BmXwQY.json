I ended up working as a storyboard artist in an advertising agency in Madrid, although the job would be best described as “coffee girl” for the all-male creative team. Despite their misogynistic ways, the team was extremely talented, and I learned a lot from them. Little by little, I managed to get a few ideas considered and eventually became the first woman art director. My first job in the U.S. became possible after I spoke to my future boss, Cuban music label design legend Carlos Segura, in Spanish. A meeting of chance led us to together redesign some major newspapers and cultural gigs in Chicago. Every other eventual job opportunity in my career has been an equal amount of serendipity and hard work to make something great.

But wanting to be a super successful individual who happens to also be a mom, is altogether more complicated. When we simply see ourselves as working moms (I have not once heard a man refer to himself as a working dad), we are already selling ourselves short. It reads as, “we are moms, who, so sorry, work.” The term seems infused by guilt, by fear, as if we need to apologize. As women, we sometimes jump to the conclusion that compromise is inevitable, that success will come at the expense of our children’s happiness. That derives from another misconception. We presume that to succeed, one must work “like a man,” keeping long hours, missing out on what happens at home and school. And that to be a good mom, one cannot expect to do all we need to do at work. We somehow see one has to come at the expense of the other: succeeding at home means not succeeding so much at work, and vice versa. I believe this is a false compromise—if we are able to shape work in a more flexible way, one that is parent-friendly. It has bene my experience that model can yield success both at work and at home."}]}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"grid","properties":{"className":["community__grid"],"background":"gray-10"},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"column","properties":{"sm":"3","md":"3","lg":"3"},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"div","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"span","properties":{"className":["community__prompt"]},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"What are your hopes and aspirations for women in design at IBM?"}]}]}]},{"type":"element","tagName":"column","properties":{"md":"6","lg":"8","offset_lg":"1"},"children":[{"type":"element","tagName":"p","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"I would love to see our women designers major on two things.

However, I hope women can do that without having to become the sole nurturers, organizers, cheerleaders, conflict resolvers, or happiness keepers. Yes, teams need to be organized and nurtured, but achieving that should be a mission for all, not just women.
