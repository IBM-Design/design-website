#### Introduce yourself.

<p size="lg">Hi, hi… I have been a practicing maker of things for the last 45ish years. I have been fortunate to do it professionally for more than half of that time. My experiences shape my perspective, and I treasure the wisdom they bring to me. As a designer, I know I have the power to observe, make, and reflect. As a business professional, I know I have the responsibility to do it with empathy. The labels I identify with are she/her, BFF/wife, Jo-Jo (my stepmom name), Type-1 diabetic, Cancer (my star sign), and (breast) cancer survivor.</p>

<span className="community__prompt">What was your path into the design profession?</span>

</column>

<column md="6" lg="8" offset_lg="1">

<p size="lg">I went to a small art school, where I honed my craft around making and learning through the make. I studied education, where we learned by doing. My first textbook was a group of 20 high school kids. I had to learn the craft of creating conditions, conditions that would make them successful. I didn’t think I was a designer; I didn’t labor over letter form; I didn't illustrate magazine covers. Instead, I obsessed about the placement of supplies on the table. How was I going to connect the lesson to a meaningful moment of theirs that would create a new neural pathway? I didn’t realize I was designing until much later.</p>

<p size="lg">But technically, how did I get started designing software, products, and experiences? After I graduated, I moved back to Rhode Island, had some art shows. Augmented my art habit bartending when my friend said, “I need someone to make images on the computer. Can you do that?” I told him I hated the computer. But he was convincing. We founded an Internet Service Provider (ISP). I learned to code, I learned how to restart the servers, I learned to quell the angry creep who would call when we did so. I taught people the wonders of the internet and clients to code their websites (not a great business model, I know). There was so much to learn, and I am a ravenous learner. I learned that I loved making experiences on the back of the internet.</p>

<span className="community__prompt">Which career stage is the hardest for women?</span>

</column>

<column md="6" lg="8" offset_lg="1">

<p size="lg">Ugh. Any stage in which women don’t trust or like themselves. Which for me, the roughest was my 20s. I talked down on myself a lot. I thought I knew things that I didn’t. I had unhealthy relationships. I had no life outside of work. I bought into the 80-90 hour work week. It was a combination of loving what I was doing, wanting to prove that I could, and not knowing how to ask for help, that I wasn’t worth support. I am a self-diagnosed introvert. Putting myself out there hurts. Combine that with self-loathing, and you get self-sabotage. Now that I am on the other side of this, I look to bridge women I see in this hard to recognize the spot and love on them. </p>

<span className="community__prompt">How would your career have been different if you were a man?</span>

</column>

<column md="6" lg="8" offset_lg="1">

<p size="lg">Yes. I don’t think I would have the sensitivities, the power of observation, the sensing, the feeling. The ability to listen and not act is a female energy trait. Would I be further along by now? Of course, I would. A reason women don’t apply to jobs that they don’t match 95% is that even if they match 100%, they still get passed over by men who match 20%. I am glad we have since progressed; a lot has changed in 25 years. I have a place in this world, and I bring my perspective, and it’s unique. Culturally, we don’t value what we don't know.</p>
