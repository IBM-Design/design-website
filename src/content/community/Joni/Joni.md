I’m a designer who gets equally excited about beauty and business impact. My background is in industrial design and design research, which grounds my thinking most of the time. I particularly love the challenge of elevating an unsexy project. In 2003, I joined IBM as an intern. Seventeen years later, I’ve had the opportunity to work on a ton of fascinating and complex projects across Systems, Cloud, Services, and most recently within the Design Program Office as Distinguished Designer for IBM’s Enterprise Design Thinking mission. My husband and I just had our second child: a baby boy. He seems to be above average in every way.

<span className="community__prompt">Which career stage is the hardest for women?</span>

</column>

<column md="6" lg="8" offset_lg="1">

You hear a lot about mid-career being one of the tougher times for women, given the challenge of potentially caring for kids and parents alongside work. I feel that in my own life, but I’d say at 41 I’m equipped to handle it.

I found the earlier years more challenging. When I first started working as a designer, I was honestly shocked and confused by some of the attitudes and situations I experienced. Coming from what I would call a healthy university environment, I often didn’t even have the language to call out what was happening in my teams, even to myself. When you combine the bad behavior of some with the reality that design itself is often the minority perspective in business, even simple product team meetings felt daunting to me sometimes. I came to appreciate formal design reviews and group critiques as important moments of truth, where expertise and new ideas get their best chance to win the day.

Today, it’s easy to think the early-career women in our teams are entering a modern environment. And while much has improved, they still experience bias, their ideas are less likely to be recognized, they’re often interrupted, and they hear an unsettling amount of “you should be more confident” coaching from well-intentioned managers. There is still plenty to do.

<span className="community__prompt">What are your hopes and aspirations for women in design at IBM?</span>

</column>

<column md="6" lg="8" offset_lg="1">

One immediate aspiration I’ve got for women in design at IBM is about mentorship. Managers often have the good intention of connecting their rising women stars with semi-random women mentors—sometimes I am that lady! This is great and should no-doubt continue. But emerging women in design also need mentorship from men who have deep and relevant experience to them—and men who are in positions of authority in and around their domain. Maybe even more so than mentorship from other women. 

If you’re a manager, encourage your rising stars toward business and technical leaders who are recognized as the best in their field. Hint: Many of these people will be men, and that’s fine!

<span className="community__prompt">Name two projects that made you the designer you are today.</span>

First, the IBM N Series hardware experience design project put the IB in IBM for me. It was the first portfolio-level design project I had responsibility for and the work was overseen by renowned industrial design consultant Richard Sapper. The design challenge was about orchestrating a very intentional brand expression and user experience for a hardware portfolio that incorporated about a zillion product assemblies, sourced from various IT vendors and manufacturers.  

Reflecting back, this is where I learned my most important lesson as an enterprise designer: good design is the easy part. If that good design never ships, you failed. To succeed with this project, I had to collaborate across IBM, with our partner NetApp, and with about a dozen businesses up and down the supply chain, all over the world. (Side note: Have you even been lost and alone in the wrong train station in Dong Guan? That is a character-building experience!)

This little suite of products filled an important niche in our Storage portfolio for about a decade, and on top of that, I received an iF design award (co-named with Richard) recognizing excellence in hardware design and usability. I keep that project in my portfolio to this day because, years later, I’m still proud of a timeless design that shipped.

Second, while at IBM, I also worked as an InnovationSpace Instructor at Arizona State University. InnovationSpace is a multidisciplinary design studio that partners senior design, business, and engineering students with sponsor companies who are on a mission to incubate. After having been a student of the program myself 10 years earlier, I returned to teach the course in 2010 alongside one of my design heroes, Professor Prasad Boradkar. (Incidentally, it was very cool of my then-manager to allow the time away for this.) In that work, I learned how to coach teams and how to think about not just teaching but designing a learning experience. I’ve drawn from this gig over and over again both as a designer in IBM’s Design Program Office and as a manager. If you haven’t taught university in some way, go do it!

<span className="community__prompt">How would your career have been different if you were a man?</span>

Well obviously, I wouldn’t be funny. And I’d get more sleep, since I’d have less hair and wear the same thing every day. 

Hmmm, if I were a man, my work ethic would probably be different. Like the old adage “there are no small parts, only small actors,” I’ve always believed there is no design project too small or too awkward to turn into something important. And I’m someone who will put in that extra time to push a project to a better place. I think both of those traits are partly a response to competing with men over time. I’m guessing if I were a man, I’d probably be right where I am—I just wouldn’t have worked as hard for it.

If you are a man established and excelling in your career, take a few women mentees under your wing. You will learn something from them, too.
