## **Design Thinking**

Design thinking shouldn't be controversial – it's simply the idea that everyone on a team should be focused on their users, first and foremost.

We built on that idea, adding strategies, tactics and activities to create a framework that uniquely scales design thinking across teams of all shapes and sizes, whether they are co-located or widely dispersed.

### Principles

<h2>The foundational elements<br>of our approach.</h2>

</column>
<column lg="4" offset_lg="4" border="true">

### Restless reinvention

_When’s the last time you rethought what you’re making?_ <br><br>Everything is a prototype. Being essential—and staying essential—requires a continuous conversation with our users and clients, responding to their changing needs through rapid prototyping and constant iteration.

### A focus on user outcomes

_Who are you designing for, and what do they need?_ <br><br>We measure success by how well we fulfill human needs. Our users are more than just the people we make for, they’re our partners in design.

### Diverse empowered teams

_Do you have the right mix of makers?_ <br><br>Diversity is the bedrock of a dynamic team. By empowering people with different skillsets, backgrounds and perspectives to bring their unique points of view to the table, we generate more breakthrough ideas faster.

### The Loop

### Observe

To drive meaningful outcomes for our users, we must first gain a deep understanding of the challenges they face.
<br><br>
By constantly immersing ourselves in the worlds of our users, we ensure that our solutions always address real-world needs.

### Reflect

Different people can interpret the same situation in very different ways.
<br><br>
Coming together to Reflect on our observations helps us synthesize and analyze findings, building a more nuanced understanding of our users across the team.

### Make

The only way to see an outcome is to make one—even if the idea isn’t fully baked yet.
<br><br>
Rapid, low-fidelity prototyping allows us to simulate ideas and test hypotheses quickly and cheaply. The end result: solutions that are robust, effective, and battle-tested.

### The keys

<h2>Tactics for maintaining alignment.</h2>

</column>
<column lg="4" offset_lg="4" border="true">

### Hills

Hills are concise statements of
the goals we aim to help our users accomplish. By making these goals explicit and evaluating them regularly, we align teams around a single shared mission.

### Playbacks

Playbacks are regular check-ins that bring users, stakeholders and teams together to tell stories and exchange feedback. They allow us to measure progress on a regular basis while uncovering and addressing any misalignment that may exist.

### Sponsor Users

Sponsor users are real-world users that provide teams with deep expertise and knowledge on the problems they’re facing. They are crucial to keeping us aligned with our users' reality throughout the course of a project.
