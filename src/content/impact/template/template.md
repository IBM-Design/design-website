## **The business case for our open-source font**

</column>
<column lg="7" offset_lg="4">

<p size="xl">For decades, we’ve relied on system
fonts like Arial and Helvetica to convey
our messages. While practical, these over-leveraged z lacked distinction; we needed a typeface that was unmistakably IBM.</p>

#### Key Users

<p size="xl">We focused on three specific groups of users as we envisioned, prototyped and iterated on the Plex typeface:</p>

1. **Rank-and-file designers.** It was crucial that Plex integrated seamlessly with the components and systems our designers were already using.
2. **Marketing practitioners.** One of the most important roles a typeface has to play is representing the brand to potential clients; integrating the perspectives of our marketers was critical to the development of Plex.
3. **Events teams.** In our highly-digital world, we often forget that typefaces have to work in physical contexts as well. Working closely with our events teams helped us prototype and iterate quickly to ensure that Plex worked well in physical environments.

### Research Insights

**If it’s not global, it’s not useful.** One theme that kept coming up in our research interviews was the linguistic differences that exist from one language to the next. IBM is a global company that operates in more than 170 different countries; a typeface that failed to account for the rich diversity of languages we use would have been a failure of design.

**Don’t forget the developers.** When talking with developers about Plex, we learned that writing code in the Terminal is a very difference experience than writing copy for a product or webpage. Many of the choices we made for the Plex Mono font were a direct result of our conversations with coders.

**More weights, more flexibility.** There are countless different ways that we use text here at IBM. Many of the designers we spoke to emphasized the need for a wide variety of weights within each typeface family so as to maximize their ability to match text to the aesthetic qualities of the context it’s being used in.

### The Impact

</column>
<column lg="7" offset_lg="4">

**Unified look and feel.** With Plex, we now have a universal font that can
be applied to anything everything IBM does. This consistency helps build brand equity externally while simultaneously driving unity internally.

**Instantly identifiable IBM-ness.** The use of Plex allows IBMers from across the business to create experiences that are immediately recognizable as coming from IBM. The importance of this distinctness cannot be overstates.

**Cost savings.** Before we created Plex, we were spending millions of dollars per year on licenses for Helvetica, Arial and a grab bag of other non-distinct fonts.

### The Solution

Plex is IBM’s first official typeface. It comes with four distinct sub-families, each with eight different weights, and is available in XX different languages.
